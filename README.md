# Hackathon App
The purpose of this app is to connect programmers with a forum of application ideas for projects and hackathons. The front end experience allows the user to view ideas submitted by their peers with filtering options. When the user registers and logins they will have access to their own dashboard where they can submit their own ideas and save other ideas to their profile. The backend experience stores ideas and user info in a MySQL database with user and password encryption.
